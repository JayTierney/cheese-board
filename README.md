## The Cheese-Board API Service

Build 3 different end-points for your server that respond with an object containing appropriate information.
eg  http://localhost/cheese/chevre would respond with :

 {
     title: 'Chevre',
     description: "The French word ch√®vre literally translate to 'goat,' and is used to refer to any cheese made from goat's milk.",
   },


The database has been built for you.  You are welcome to try more complex responses to an HTTP request.


Don't forget to install the project!
